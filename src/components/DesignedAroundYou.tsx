            At VIVA, our learners are the heroes. Every update begins with a single question: <span className="text-foreground font-semibold">"What do our users need most?"</span>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We understand there isn't one "right" outcome for a musician. We celebrate the many ways people grow — from bedroom producers and singers to world-class instrumentalists.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Through feedback loops, user stories, and constant dialogue, we evolve VIVA to reflect the people who inspire it: you.
