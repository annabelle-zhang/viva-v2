            To democratise music education — giving anyone, anywhere, the tools to learn, practise, and fall in love with music. We want every person, no matter where they come from, to experience the joy of learning music with guidance that feels personal.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Just as we were lucky to learn from world-class teachers, we want to share that privilege globally. Our tool empowers those who never imagined they could become musicians — including people in rural or under-resourced communities.
