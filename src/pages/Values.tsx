      description: "We design VIVA around real musicians' needs. Every user's goals, challenges, and journey drive our priorities. No two paths look the same — and that's what makes our community inspiring. We ask \"Who can help?\" rather than \"How do we do this?\" because the right people accelerate progress."

      title: "Collaborate Like a Band",
      description: "Great music — and great products — are built together. We blend creativity, accountability, and honest communication so our team stays in rhythm. We hire people who raise the bar in competence, character, and culture, and build a shared mission that feels like being part of a band or orchestra."

      title: "Feedback Is Our Forte",
      description: "Listening is part of our DNA. We collect and act on meaningful insights, practicing Kaizen to make small improvements every day. We celebrate momentum, because progress motivates more than perfection. Our users see themselves reflected in VIVA's evolution."

      title: "Give Back to the Music",
      description: "Every VIVA learner helps fund instruments, programs, and opportunities for the next generation. We invest in musical dreams at a time when arts funding is disappearing. Being part of VIVA means contributing to something bigger — a mission-driven, global music community."

            <p>
              We believe every musician deserves direction, encouragement, and feedback that fuel real growth. Musicians progress most when they receive guidance right when they're stuck — so VIVA listens, watches, and gives real-time direction to help them problem-solve, reflect, and move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
              We're not about chasing perfection. We're about progress, joy, and possibility. Our users are the heroes of our story — we simply build the tools that help them unlock their potential. 🌍
